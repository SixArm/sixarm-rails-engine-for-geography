SixArm Ruby On Rails Engine For Localities
==========================================

Easy functionality for typical localities:
* Continents
* Countries
* Subcountries
* City
* Districts
* Neighborhood

All of these localities can also use this helper class:
* Regionals: includes latitude, longitude, population, area


== Indexing

We index liberally because we've seen signficant speedups doing this.

We index names because we use this for AJAX-style autocompletion.


== Internationalization

To enable easier internationalization:
* name_en is the name in English

You can add your own names in other languages:
* name_fr is the name in French
* name_it is the name in Italian
* name_gr is the name is Greek
* etc.


== Seed Data

* Continent seed data for North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania
* Country seed data from ISO-2, ISO-3, United Nations 3-digit numeric, etc.
* Subcountry seed data from ISO codes for U.S. states, Canada's provinces, etc.
* District seed data will be added if/when we find good free standards
* City seed data will be added if/when we find good free standards.
* Regional seed data comes from all the other seed data, e.g. the Country seed data includes latitude and longitude
